--Ranked by best 0.5(STAB_resist) + (movetype_resist); tie breakers by higher base stat total, or if equal then by better moves

Gym1, Rock
Onix, Heracross, Cherubi, Snorlax, Ambipom, Piplup
#Heracross, Munchlax, and Aipom can all be found at honey trees--may not be necessary/worth the hastle to get all
#Turwig is better starter for the first two gyms, but Piplups evolutions are more useful later on

Gym2, Grass
Dustox, Skorupi, Zubat, Roserade, Vespiquen, Mothim

Gym3, Ghost
Togekiss, Chatot, Staravia, Hoothoot, Honchkrow, Stunky

Gym4, Fighting
Spiritomb, Bronzor, Mismagius, Duskull, Scizor, Rotom
#Rotom could be reasonably replaced with Gastrodon, Whiscash, or Quagsire 

Gym5, Water
Empoleon, Vaporeon, Golduck, Floatzel, Octillery, Lumineon
#this gym is less clear, since water is resistant to water, choices will heavily depend on moves your pokemon can learn 
#NOTE: Gyrados is slighly less resistant, but has high base stats which might put him ahead of lower-stat mono-water types

Gym6, Steel
Gastrodon, Whiscash, Quagsire, Gliscor, Gibble, Empoleon

Gym7, Ice
Empoleon, Scizor, Lucario, Weavile, Bibarel, Magnezone
#Bronzong honorable mention

Gym8, Electric
Gastrodon, Whiscash, Quagsire, Steelix, Rhyperior, Golem
