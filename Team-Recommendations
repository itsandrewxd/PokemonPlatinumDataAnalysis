--Ranked by best 0.5(STAB_resist) + (movetype_resist); tie breakers by higher base stat total, or if equal then by better moves
--Best use this ranking for a conservative approach to gym battles; possibly a nuzlocke where there's higher stakes for fainting

Gym1, Rock
Onix, Heracross, Cherubi, Snorlax, Ambipom, Piplup
#Heracross, Munchlax, and Aipom can all be found at honey trees--may not be necessary/worth the hastle to get all
#Turwig is better starter for the first two gyms, but Piplups evolutions are more useful later on

Gym2, Grass
Dustox, Skorupi, Zubat, Roserade, Vespiquen, Mothim 
#Beautifly honorable mention
#bug types are good against this gym only, maybe go light on leveling
#maybe consider flying types(that can learn fly) and will be useful in gym 3

Gym3, Ghost
Togekiss, Chatot, Staravia, Noctowl, Honchkrow, Stunky

Gym4, Fighting
Spiritomb, Bronzor, Mismagius, Duskull, Scizor, Rotom
#Rotom could be reasonably replaced with Gastrodon, Whiscash, or Quagsire 

Gym5, Water
Empoleon, Vaporeon, Golduck, Floatzel, Octillery, Lumineon
#this gym is less clear, since water is resistant to water, choices will heavily depend on moves your pokemon can learn 
#NOTE: Gyrados is slighly less resistant, but has high base stats which might put him ahead of lower-stat mono-water types

Gym6, Steel
Gastrodon, Whiscash, Quagsire, Gliscor, Gibble, Empoleon

Gym7, Ice
Empoleon, Scizor, Lucario, Weavile, Bibarel, Magnezone
#Bronzong honorable mention

Gym8, Electric
Gastrodon, Whiscash, Quagsire, Steelix, Rhyperior, Golem


--Repeat best pokemon are Empoleon, Gastrodon, Wiscash, Quagsire, Onix/Steelix, Scizor
--Bibarel had consistently good typing and can learn most HMs, consider for playthrough
--Rotom also had consistently good base typing, is flexible, and has high base stats
